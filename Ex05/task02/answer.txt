Since a global scope object "Hellotext" has been declared, the compiler 
calls the constructor of the "Hellotext" object before the main function,
therefore "---start---" is printed on the console. Then the destructor of 
the object is called by the compiler when the main function terminates,
and "---end---" is printed out after the printing of the main function.
